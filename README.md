This project demonstrates the use of SQL aggregate functions such as `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()` and the `GROUP BY` clause to analyze tabular data.

## 🧱 Table Used:
**StudentMarks** with the following columns:
- `StudentID`: Unique student identifier
- `Name`: Student name
- `Department`: Academic department
- `Marks`: Score obtained

## 🔍 Key SQL Concepts:
- `GROUP BY` for grouping rows
- `HAVING` to filter grouped results
- `ROUND()` to format output
- Aggregate functions for summarization

## 📊 Sample Queries:
- Total and average marks by department
- Count of students in each department
- Departments with average marks above 80
- Highest and lowest marks per department

## 📁 Output:
All queries produce structured summaries useful for reports and analysis.

## ✅ Tools Used:
- MySQL Workbench / DB Browser for SQLite
